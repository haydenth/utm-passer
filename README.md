UTM PASSER
============

This library when installed on a page will enforce that the following three variables: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, and `utm_campaign` get passed to any other link on that page.


Installation
------------

This is currently being hosted on a CDN (thanks to the release script). To put on a page, put this code snippet JUST BEFORE the `</body>` tag.

```
<script src="https://cdn.hngr.co/js/utm-passer.min.js"></script>
```
